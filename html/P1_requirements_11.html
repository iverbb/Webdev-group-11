    <h2>Client</h2>
    <!-- Project: Outdo squarespace -->
    <p>Client:
        <a href="https://www.barkarkitekter.no/" target="_blank">
            Bark Arkitekter AS
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>Contact Person: Frode Brurberg, CEO, partner and architect MNAL in Bark Arkitekter AS.</p>
    <p>
        Bark Arkitekter (est. 2006) is a small architect firm based in Stavanger, Norway, that works on producing
        timeless building design in the Stavanger region.
        The firm consists of five architects MNAL who have all gotten their education from different parts of the world
        – Brighton, Auckland, Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen – making their design many-sided and unique.
        They aim to find the best solution for a building’s design in cooperation with the client, and are consistently
        trying to understand what it really is that the client wants.
        Bark’s projects vary from private houses and cabins to public schools and kindergartens, as well as commercial
        building projects.

    <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of the website is mainly to showcase Bark’s projects, attracting both customers and potential new
        employees.
        The website should work as an inspiring portfolio displaying their architectural projects in an appealing way.
        It has to show the whole spectrum of their work and the variation within each building category, making it clear
        that the building design is customized to both the client and the building’s surroundings.
        This can be done through making an own tab for projects, and then sorting them into different categories.
        As well as being a pleasantly looking home for Bark’s projects, it has to be inviting for their clientele,
        making it feel easy to get in contact with the firm.
        Bark Arkitekter should not be presented as unattainable or as a mammoth in architecture design, but as the
        small, local and inviting firm it is.
        Bark also wants the clients to be able to be more active when visiting the website, making the experience more
        playful.
        This can be done by having interactive elements such as a map. The audience can navigate through the different
        projects visually and active by clicking on the different pinpoints on the map
        As noted, the website should attract potential new employees. This should be done through presenting Bark
        Arkitekter as an interesting, stimulating and professional workplace, and through being informative of the
        opportunities you’ve got when working for Bark.
        In conclusion the website has to satisfy the needs of both an untrained private person as well as a professional
        architect, informing them of the opportunities they’ve got as clients or employees. It has to feel inviting for
        the visitors, making it seem easy to contact Bark and having a chat about a potential project. The website has
        to communicate Bark’s distinctive style, and to avoid presenting their projects as modular buildings.

    <h2>Target Demography</h2>
    <p>
        The visitors of the website are private clients, professional building developers, commercial actors, public
        developers, potential new employees and partners, students and people interested in architecture.

        For the private clients the website should give information of how the whole process works – from drawing to
        building. It should show what their possibilities and opportunities as customers are, as well as making them
        able to explore and look at earlier projects done by Bark. It is important that the website is inviting for the
        private customers, as they need to feel like it is easy to get in contact with the firm.

        For the professional building developers the website has to make it clear that Bark also works with larger
        projects, and not only smaller private housing. This also applies to the municipal or state actors. Bark
        Arkitekter has been working with public projects such as schools and kindergartens, so these projects need to be
        drawn attention to.

        As mentioned, for attracting potential new employees, the website needs to make Bark Arkitekter look like an
        interesting and diverse workplace. The website needs to include their portfolio, inspirational work, photography
        and drawings of earlier and current projects, as well as news of on-going projects or publicity in papers or
        magazines. It has to be continuously updated with what Bark is doing in their current projects for it to be
        visible that they are active and relevant. Bark specified that the website needs to include a page where their
        current projects are displayed.

        These demands apply for students or other people who are interested in architecture as well. As these visitors
        are interested in aesthetics, it is crucial that the website is visually pleasing and interesting with
        possibilities to explore.

    <h2>Website Architecture</h2>
    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>The home page will be an introduction page for the website, making it essential that it gives the visitor a great
        first impression of Bark Arkitekter. It has to be visually pleasing, sparking an interest, and easy to navigate
        in. Bark specified that the websites need to have a menu available at all times, making it easy to navigate for
        all visitors. Here we are exploring the possibility of making Bark to be able to share their current projects
        “på tegnebordet” (“on the drawing board”), and to share news of citations in magazines etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>We will need to make a page with contact information, describing where you can find Bark Arkitekter and how you
        can reach them: the office address, phone number and email address. It should inform clients how they can get in
        contact. As the firm is dependent on clients, this page needs to feel like it is inviting to a conversation and
        in addition it has to make it clear that it’s simple to get in contact with them.
    </p>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>There has to be a page where the firm can brand themselves – who are they and what is their vision. This page
        should include information about the firm, the employees, and how they do their work. We are possibly including
        a description of the whole building process, from the client making contact to sketching ideas to the final
        result.
    </p>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>As we need to include Bark’s portfolio, we need to make a page for all of their projects. This page has to make
        some kind of sorting of content possible. Most essential is sorting through the different types of building
        projects: holiday homes, residential housing, smaller buildings, commercial buildings and other projects. We are
        also exploring the possibility of making several filtering functions – chronologically, alphabetical,
        programmatic, scale and status. We would also like to try to include a map showing where the buildings are
        located.
    </p>
    <h3>Header</h3>
    <p>The header needs to include all of these pages, as well as the logo, at all times. This is to make navigation as
        simple as possible. If possible there could be some movement on the site which could contribute to a more
        playful experience, but having in mind that it will not cause disturbances nor annoyance.

    <h2>Client Preferences</h2>
    <p>Bark Arkitekter, being an architecture firm, wants the website to have a pleasing design. They want a clean and
        simple layout, but with active elements that make the website feel more playful. The color palette should not be
        dominating, but color should instead be integrated through the drawings and photographs of their projects. Fonts
        used in headlines and descriptions should be simple and easy to read.
    </p>
    <p>In addition to the stylistic demands from Bark, they would also like us to make it clear that their firm has a
        green and sustainable approach to architecture.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Final Location</h2>
    <p>The final location of the website is currently not decided. Bark Arkitekter will probably not use our suggestion
        as their new website because of difficulties regarding the constant updating of their projects. We can’t expect
        them to learn programming in order to be able to update their content. It is more likely that they will continue
        to use their current website, which is a simple squarespace website. However, they might implement some of our
        design and structured solutions. Hence we believe that the final location might have to be at one of our student
        servers.

    <h2>Functional and Non-functional Requirements</h2>
    <h3>Functional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The visitor should easily find their needs wherever they are, and all information should be easily
            accessible. The website has to be easy to navigate . If a client wants a specific project the website has to
            make it simple to find similar projects in the same category.
        </li>
        <li>The website has to clearly showcase the different projects and work of Bark. A clear visualization of their
            spectre of projects is especially important. Equally essential is an elegant, modern and beautiful
            presentation of their work. The design is vital in bringing attention to the projects.
        </li>
        <li>It should be easy to navigate. Navigational choices should be few, precise and cover all needs.
        </li>
        <li>More playfulness should be achieved through introducing more interactive elements. Bark wants the visitor to
            be able to be more active in unison with the website.
        </li>
        <li>The colors used need to meet contrast demands for the sake of accessibility and certain disabilities, as
            well as aesthetics. The alt textes for the images also have to be well-describing.
        </li>
        <li>Contact information has to be easily accessible at all times.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Non-functional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A maximum of two clicks to get to where the visitor wants to go.
        </li>
        <li>The menu has to be accessible at all times.
        </li>
        <li>The home page is always one click away. A home button in addition to clicking on the logo.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roadblocks and Technical Difficulties</h2>
    <p>
    Updates become cumbersome, as databases are not available, thus making an admin dashboard amounts to
    hacking, i.e. most likely impossible or impractical


    Et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas?
    Mi ipsum, faucibus vitae aliquet nec, ullamcorper sit.
    Urna, molestie at elementum eu, facilisis sed odio.
    Nisi, quis eleifend quam adipiscing vitae proin sagittis!

    Handling custom url queries might prove challenging.


    Adjusting map view coordinates to real coordinates might be somewhat challenging, especially with respect to
    map size increases(whenever Bark arkitekter takes over the capital) one option is to use a large map and
    zoom it. This might cause loading issues, if the image is large. Might be worth looking into making a
    stylized map in svg.


    Due to the amount of photos and sketches we should keep in mind the loading time of the webpages
