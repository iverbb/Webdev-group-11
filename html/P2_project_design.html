      <h2>Client</h2>
      <!-- Project: Outdo squarespace -->
      <p>Client:
        <a href="https://www.barkarkitekter.no/" target="_blank">
          Bark Arkitekter AS
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact Person: Frode Brurberg, CEO, partner and architect MNAL in Bark Arkitekter AS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bark Arkitekter (est. 2006) is a small architect firm based in Stavanger, Norway,
        that works on producing timeless building design in the Stavanger region.
        The firm consists of five architects MNAL who have all gotten their education from
        different parts of the world – Brighton, Auckland, Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen – making
        their design many-sided and unique.
        They aim to find the best solution for a building’s design in cooperation with
        the client, and are consistently trying to understand what it really is that the client
        wants.
        Bark’s projects vary from private houses and cabins to public schools and kindergartens,
        as well as commercial building projects.

      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is mainly to showcase Bark’s projects, attracting both
        customers and potential new employees. The website should work as an inspiring portfolio
        displaying their architectural projects in an appealing way. It has to show the whole
        spectrum of their work and the variation within each building category, making it clear
        that the building design is customized to both the client and the building’s surroundings.
        This can be done through making an own tab for projects, and then sorting them into
        different categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as being a pleasantly looking home for Bark’s projects, it has to be inviting for
        their clientele, making it feel easy to get in contact with the firm. Bark Arkitekter
        should not be presented as unattainable or as a mammoth in architecture design, but as
        the small, local and inviting firm it is. Bark also wants the clients to be able to be
        more active when visiting the website, making the experience more playful. This can be
        done by having interactive elements such as a map. The audience can navigate through the
        different projects visually and active by clicking on the different pinpoints on the map.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted, the website should attract potential new employees. This
        should be done through presenting Bark Arkitekter as an interesting,
        stimulating and professional workplace, and through being informative of
        the opportunities you’ve got when working for Bark.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion the website has to satisfy the needs of both an untrained
        private person as well as a professional architect, informing them of
        the opportunities they’ve got as clients or employees. It has to feel
        inviting for the visitors, making it seem easy to contact Bark and
        having a chat about a potential project. The website has to communicate
        Bark’s distinctive style, and to avoid presenting their projects as
        modular buildings.

      <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
      <img id="navstucture" src="../img/P2/Navstructure.png" alt="navstructure" title="navstructure" width=100%>
      <p>
        Our functional and non-functional from P1 were kept in mind when deciding upon a navigation structure for the web page.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The menu is accessible at all times, which leads to the homepage and the other main pages (like contact and projects), to always be one click away. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The navigational choices are few, precise and cover all needs. 
        </li>
        <li>
          The webpage showcases all the different projects and work of Bark. 
          The projects page and the filtering function is responsible for this.
        </li>
        <li>
          The information the visitor wants is maximum three clicks away. 
          For example, if  a visitor wants to have a look on a specific private home, they have to click at projects > private homes > specific_home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contact information is easily accessible at all times, both through the navbar and the footer.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We have kept the basic structure simple, but included extra elements in the different pages to make it an interactive and fun experience.

      <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2F7wQB0DQrxE0Z3xwN4rhuGS%2FP2-Mockup%3Fnode-id%3D3%253A0%26viewport%3D155%252C361%252C0.03990497812628746%26scaling%3Dscale-down-width&chrome=DOCUMENTATION" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bark Arkitekter, being an architecture firm, wants the website to have a pleasing design. 
        They want a clean and simple layout, with active elements that make the website feel more playful. 
        The color palette should not be dominating, but color should instead be integrated through the drawings and photographs of their projects. 
        Fonts used in headlines and descriptions should be simple and easy to read, as well as stylistic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        These preferences have been decisive for our design decisions.  
      </p>
      <h3>Color scheme</h3>
      <p>
        As they wanted a non-dominating color scheme, we have decided upon using white, black and grey/light grey/dark grey. 
        The background color is white (#ffffff), while the text is dark grey to assure good readability. 
        This applies to the navbar, the pages and the footer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By having a simple color scheme, we will make the photographs and drawings from projects the center of attention, which is the main goal of the website. 
        Projects will not have to compete with distracting background design. 
        Another advantage of the neutral color scheme is that it fits all projects. 
        We are assuring ourselves that every project is framed nicely. 
        If we had used more color, we would have to do far more work with having to adapt the background color to fit the project’s colors. 
        Instead we are creating an expression which connects all of Bark’s work. 
      </p>
      <h3>Font</h3>
      <p>
        We are only using one font, Futura PT. 
        Futura PT is a modern, geometric font, with roots in the major design and architecture institution of Bauhaus. 
        Futura, which it is based on, is a sans serif with an exceptional characteristic style. 
        Futura PT is the quiet cousin of the original, but is still managing to preserve the style and feeling of Futura. 
        In this way we are referencing the architectural aspect of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Futura PT is easy to read as well as it is stylistic. 
        We will use a variation of different styles of the font: book, demi and oblique, in addition to different sizing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Current suggestions for sizing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Navbar: 24pt, book
        </li>
        <li>
          Hamburger button, projects: 24pt, book
        </li>
        <li>
          Paragraph: 20pt, book
        </li>
        <li>
          Title of each filteroption: 18pt, demi
        </li>
        <li>
          Title of each project in gallery: 20pt, book
        </li>
        <li>
          Title of specific project: 36pt, demi
        </li>
        <li>
          Home: 18pt, book
        </li>
        <li>
          News: 16pt, book
        </li>
        <li>
          Copyright: 18pt, book
        </li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Navbar</h3>
      <p>
        One of Bark’s requirements for the page is that the website needs to have a menu available at all times, making it easy to navigate for all visitors. 
        Since the navigation bar is going to be available at all times, it must fit stylishly to all the pages of the website, and not draw too much attention. 
        We have therefore chosen to have a quite simple navbar at the top of the page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The navbar will include Bark’s logo on the left and buttons for the different pages on the right. 
        It will have a white background to be in style with the rest of the website. The different pages (home, projects, on the drawing board, about and contact) will all be written in text to avoid misunderstandings. 
        When the user is at one of the pages this will be marked by underlining the name of the page in the navbar. 
        In addition to making navigation easier, this relieves us of having a title at the top of all the different pages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as having a home button, the Bark logo will also work as a link to navigate back home. This decision is based on current standards in web design. 
        The navbar will also be fixed on  the top of the browser window to ensure simple navigation. 
        This means that even though the user scrolls a long way down in the project gallery, their way back home does not demand a lot of scrolling, just a simple click. 
      </p>
      <h3>Footer</h3>
      <p>
        Bark demanded that contact information should be available at all times. 
        Due to this, the footer includes contact information, office address and copyright in all pages of the website. 
        This way the user can both find information from accessing the contact page in the navbar, or through scrolling down to the footer. 
        From earlier eye tracking we know that users often tend to scroll down to the footer when trying to find company information, making this decision reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same fact applies to the footer as to the navigation bar: Since the footer is going to be available at all pages, it must fit stylishly to all the pages of the website, and not draw too much attention. 
      </p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Our current design suggestion has taken all of Bark’s demands into account. 
        The design makes sure that the audience can easily navigate through the pages with the navbar. 
        By having a simple layout, the audience is drawn to the projects and content without distractions. 
        The grid layout makes all the pages cohesive, making sure that the design shines through the whole website. 
        One main part to this grid is that we are working towards making the website a suitable gallery for their projects. 
        It is important that the audience can look through all the projects with pleasure and simplicity. 
        In our figma mock-up you can test the navigation and see our suggestions for the individual pages of the website. 
        However, due to the fact that it is just a simple prototype, there are some bugs in it that don’t correspond with our thoughts of the design solution. 
        When scrolling through the project gallery the photographs overlap with the navbar, which they clearly are not intended to do. 
        In the about us page, the browser should freeze in a specific position when opening the timeline. 
      </p>

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Loading page</h3>
      <img id="loading page" src="../img/P2/Loading page.png" alt="loading page" title="loading page" width=100%>
      <p>
        When arriving at the website, the user will meet a jumping dot. 
        Bark’s logo has a dot on the end which we intend to utilize to make the loading of the page more interesting. 
        We will use a JavaScript function to make it jump for three seconds while the website is loading in the background. 
        We have given it the set time of three seconds as JavaScript can not detect when the website is finished loading.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the three seconds have passed, the dot will jump to its place in the logo in the navbar and the user is free to explore Bark’s website. 
        In addition to the jumping dot letting the website and its pictures load in the background, it is contributing to the website with a fun element. 
      </p>
      <h3>Home</h3>
      <img id="homepage" src="../img/P2/Home.png" alt="homepage" title="homepage" width=100%>
      <p>
        The home page will be an introduction to the website, making it essential that it gives the visitor a great first impression of Bark Arkitekter. 
        It has to be visually pleasing, spark an interest for Bark’s work, and be easy to navigate in. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are welcoming the visitor with large photos of Bark’s work to introduce their style – both in regards to their building design and graphic web design. 
        The photos will change after some time, and there is also the possibility to manually switch the photos. 
        This is done by hovering over the photos, and arrows will come in sight on the left and right side of the photo. 
        As this is a website that represents them and their aesthetical figure, we need to be careful to present Bark in a way they would like to be represented. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the grand opening with the grand pictures, we are including an introductory paragraph on who Bark are and what their architectural or even societal vision is. 
        A short description to capture some interest, and nudge the visitor to want to read more about Bark and their projects in the other pages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Underneath we will have a newsroom where Bark can publish news about the company – if they have received new projects, won design competitions or employed new architects. 
        This will also be an arena for Bark to share mentions in magazines, newspapers or blogs. 
        The newsroom will give them a chance to brag about their achievements.  
      </p>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        As we are going to showcase Bark’s portfolio, we need to make a page for all of their projects. 
        The project page is supposed to make the visitor’s search for relevant projects easily and in a fun way. 
        We have therefore chosen to make a filtering function which allows the visitor to sort the projects in four ways: type of project (holiday homes, commercial buildings etc.), chronologically (by date), location (map showing where the buildings are located) and ideas for projects. 
        The visitor can access the filtering function through a hamburger menu which shows a drop down menu of the filters. 
        Even though the visitors are able to filter the projects, they will automatically be sent to the filtering of project types when entering the project page. 
        This is due to the fact that most visitors will be interested in finding similar projects to the ones they are building. 
        In this way we are reducing the amount of clicks the visitor has to make. 
        If a potential client wants to look at Bark’s holiday homes, it is only two clicks away from the home page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The projects are in all categories presented in a portrait frame within a strict grid. The number of images in a row will follow the width of the browser, and be a maximum of three images. 
        We would like to make the grid even, so that all the whitespace between the images and the margin of the browser is the same. 
        This will make it look even cleaner. We are going to include a hover function. When hovering a picture, the name and year of the project will appear. 
        In addition, the color of the image will change. In the mockup we have made all the pictures B/W, and when you hover the picture, it becomes colored/RGB mode. 
        We have not quite decided upon whether we are going to solve it this way (by using B/W) or something similar - so far this is just an example of a way to solve it. 
        By including the hover function, you have to be a bit more active when scrolling through projects, which was what Bark wished for. 
        The user is also more drawn to a specific project when hovering over it, since the project is more emphasized. 
        These features will also make the visitor aware of the possibility to click the pictures to get to the project description page. 
      </p>
      <h3>Projects/ Type of project</h3>
      <img id="projecttype" src="../img/P2/prosjekttype.png" alt="project type" title="project type" width=100%>
      <p>
        As mentioned, this filter will be the first one visitors will arrive at when entering the project page. With the project type filter the page will only include six pictures, representing the six categories: holiday homes, buildings, homes, commercial buildings, smaller buildings and others. 
        The category name will be below the image, on the left side. 
        The category name will be available at all times, not only on hover. 
        This will be more effective and precise, making it easier to navigate in. 
        It is, as mentioned, likely that a visitor is looking for Bark’s holiday homes, and this has to be easy to navigate to.
      </p>
      <p>
        When clicking at a project type, you will arrive at a page with the universal project look – as described earlier. 
        Here there will only be projects from the category you have chosen.
      </p>
      <h3>Projects/ Chronological</h3>
      <img id="chronological" src="../img/P2/kronologisk.png" alt="chronological" title="chronological" width=100%>
      <p>
        By sorting projects chronological, their newest projects will appear first. 
        Every project will be represented by one picture, and it will be possible to click at the picture to read more about the project. 
        The layout of the images will follow the same strict grid as described earlier.  
      </p>
      <h3>Projects/ Location</h3>
      <img id="location" src="../img/P2/map.png" alt="location" title="location" width=100%>
      <p>
        Map showing where the buildings are located. We are going to make a simple map over Stavanger in Illustrator as svg file, and have pins for their projects on the map. 
        When hovering over pins an image of the project will be made visible, and you can access the project site through clicking it. 
        By making an interactive map we create engagement from the visitor. 
      </p>
      <h3>Projects/ Ideas</h3>
      <img id="ideas" src="../img/P2/ideer.png" alt="ideas" title="ideas" width=100%>
      <p>
        When filtering ideas, the visitor will be shown other kinds of projects. 
        Projects that have not been realized, projects that were made for fun, drawings or inspirational projects. 
        An example of this is the project called Pedersgata where school children were invited to draw a suggestion of how the street could be developed. 
      </p>
      <h3>Projects/ Project detail view</h3>
      <img id="project detail view" src="../img/P2/prosjektdetaljert.png" alt="project detail view" title="project detail view" width=100%>
      <p>
        When clicking on a project, pictures and informative text from the clicked project will lay on top of the project page. 
        These pictures will not follow the regular project grid. 
        The background (the project page) will be added a white opaque filter so that it will not disturb. 
        To get back to the other projects you can click on the background, or use the cross in the right upper corner (this cross is yet to be added in the mock-up).
      </p>
      <h3>"På tegnebordet"</h3>
      <img id="paa tegnebordet" src="../img/P2/På tegnebordet.png" alt="paa tegnebordet" title="paa tegnebordet" width=100%>
      <p>
        “On the drawing board” is a category that differs Bark arkitekter from other architecture firms. 
        This page will show what projects Bark are currently working on – or more precisely, what they are currently having on their drawing board. 
        Both potential new employees and other visitors might find this interesting. 
        The page shows that there are new upcoming projects currently happening, and that the firm is active. 
        There will mainly be drawings illustrating projects and short texts describing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would also like to include an additional function to this page. 
        When entering you will meet a blank page, and then drawings of their projects will start to be drawn. 
        This can be solved through using gifs, or potentially JavaScript. 
        We will have to do some testing on how doable this is. 
        As the drawings have already been drawn, we will have to use tools such as photoshop or illustrator. 
      </p>
      <h3>About us</h3>
      <img id="about us" src="../img/P2/About us 1.png" alt="about us" title="about us" width=100%>
      <img id="about us click" src="../img/P2/About us click.png" alt="about us click" title="about us click" width=100%>
      <p>
        In the about page we are including the vision of the company and a list of all the employees. 
        The list includes their names, titles, university background and e-mail address. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes the about page interactive is a timeline over Bark’s most important projects. 
        The timeline is a thin line with small white faded (might change to B/W to keep in style with the project page or the theme we end up with) pictures of projects and the project name. 
        When hovering over a picture it will change to clear color/RGB, enabling clicking. 
        As in the project page, when clicking on a picture in the timeline, the background will have a white opaque filter and a large version of the picture will be made visible, so that the picture stands out. 
        The layout will be the same as the project detail view. 
        In addition to the picture, we will have the name of the project, the building year, and a link to see more of the project. 
        There will also be two arrows so that you can click back and forth in the timeline. 
        These arrows will be the same as the ones in the home page, however that has not been fixed in the mock-up.
        As in the project you can exit the timeline by clicking the background, or click on the cross in the right upper corner (also yet to be added to the mock-up).
      </p>
      <h3>Contact</h3>
      <img id="contact" src="../img/P2/Kontakt.png" alt="contact" title="contact" width=100%>
      <p>
        In the contact page we are including information on how to get in touch with Bark. 
        As described in P1 this page needs to feel inviting for the visitors in order for them to get in touch without hesitation. 
        We will be including the office address, phone number, email address and a picture of the office location. 
        Additionally we should include some sort of description of how easy it is to contact them. 
        We have therefore made a suggestion of including simple drawings that are quickly explaining the steps of getting in touch with, and working with, Bark.
        It is supposed to be a simple explaination of the architectural working process. 
        The drawings will suit the overall design of the website.
        Bark could possibly be included in making the drawings to have them be in the same style as the rest of the website.
        However, how the drawings are going to look and exactly what information they will be providing is yet to be decided upon. 
        These drawings will contribute in making the website playful, as well as giving a feeling of low threshold of contacting Bark.

      <h3>Version for phone and tablet</h3>
      <img id="tablet" src="../img/P2/Tablet.png" alt="tablet" title="tablet" width=100%>
      <img id="mobile" src="../img/P2/Mobile.png" alt="mobile" title="mobile" width=50%>
      <p>
        The phone and tablet versions should be quite similar to the version for desktop, but adjusted in terms of how much information you get on each page. 
        It will not make sense with a hovering function, but the hovering could possibly be substituted with a pressing function.
        The tablet version is slighty compressed, but looks quite similar to the desktop version.
        The version for phones will have a hamburger menu with links to the other pages so that it fits the screen better. 
        There is a link to both a phone and a tablet version on the home page in the prototype.
        These are qick prototypes and haven't been completely decided upon yet.

      <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the groups relatively high work capacity we don't see the minimum requirements
        on javascript as particularly relevant, expecting to go well beyond them, in fact two
        javascript files were used in the creation of this page alone.
        We consider these functions to make up a minimum viable product, these also cover the
        minimum requirement posed by the assignment:
      </p>
      <h3>marg.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde will implement a script that automatically adds headers and footers to every
        html page. This aids in modularity by not having to write the same html over and over.
        A maybe even bigger advantage is that it makes for a more robust solution with respect
        to updates, as it eliminates the risk of forgetting to update the navbar of an html page.
        Due to current design not featuring a dropdown menu we consider this to be the most
        straight forward of all the scripts we have planned, and it should not present issues.
      </p>
      <h3>gallerimeny.js</h3>
      <p>
        Nora will implement gallerimeny.js, a burger menu that calls loads the appropriate
        project viewer, either a gallery or an interactive map, implemented separately.
        Functionality wise this would not be significantly harder than implementing a navbar;
        a list of hrefs, however it might be worth having it recognize whether it is in a
        gallery or a mapview, and if switching between gallery filters have it not reload the
        entire page, but rather call the appropriate filtering function of the gallery instead.
      </p>
      <h3>data.js</h3>
      <p>
        Hedvig will implement data.js, this is not functionally a script, but rather declares
        an object in which to store project data, with paths, descriptions and other relevant
        information, for ease of access. This is essentially a proxy json, as reading straight
        json files would be challenging without frameworks, and implementing an efficient
        json parser from scratch in javascript would be a very complex task.
      </p>
      <h3>galleri.js</h3>
      <p>
        Hedvig will implement galleri.js, a script that will display project images in a regular
        grid. It will load image data from data.js, filter according to input filter and
        load images from img/. Likely thumbnails will be made, so as not to make loading take
        too much time/bandwidth.
      </p>
      <h3>bildeviser.js</h3>
      <p>
        Nora will implement bildeviser.js, a function that will show a larger sized image of
        a clicked thumbnail, with blurred/transparent background, and appropriately scaled
        imaged for a given viewport. It will show basic information about the project, such
        as production date, title, location, etc. There are also plans for the possibility
        for this to link to a more detailed information page on the project, if such information
        exists for a given project, however this is not part of the minimum requirements.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Planned</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        These are all the functionality that are planned as a main part of the project. We are
        fairly confident in achieving these goals. They are the ones marked with at most a single
        asterisk in the work distribution table. 
      </p>
      <h3>tidslinje.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde will implement tidslinje.js, a script for showing an interactive timeline over
        projects created by the company. It will feature a sidescrolling gallery of project
        thumbnails greyed out that will regain color on hover.
      </p>
      <h3>laster.js</h3>
      <p>
        Parisa will implement laster.js, a script that will display a dynamic loading animation
        prior to page load. We see three possible implementations of this: a gif running at
        predefined length, using displaying a gif for a duration dependent on
        "document.readyState", or implementing the animation using canvas, possibly with
        interactive easter eggs, however the latter falls squarely into the "nice to have"
        category, both due to technical challenges, and the relatively minor added value.
      </p>
      <h3>kart.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver will implement kart.js, an interactive map displaying projects on a map over
        Stavanger. Loading location from data.js it will display a marker on the map, which
        will on hover expand to a project view. This is more or less done already.
      </p>
      <h3>mobilmeny.js</h3>
      <p>
        Clicking individual tabs on a navbar on mobile can be frustrating. As such a burgermenu
        will replace the navbar for smaller viewports. This mobile menu will largely be reusing
        the gallery selector menu assigned to Nora, with minor tweaks to styling and content.
      </p>
      <h3>enkeltprosjekt.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver will create a function for filling html templates with project data and imagery
        based on querystring, likely using regex. This will make for easier sharing,
        either on social media, or peer to peer, as well as more modular updates, due to the
        lack of a need for making separate html pages for every new project added to the page.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Nice to Haves</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        These are files and ideas that would be cool to implement, but either are less relevant
        to the course, too technical to guarantee, or both. They will be given an honest effort,
        however we'll lose no sleep over not accomplishing them. As such they feature neither
        deadline nor specific asignee in the work distribution table. They are noted by double
        asterisk.
      </p>
      <h3>tegne.js</h3>
      <p>
        tegne.js is a task of obviously different scope from the others, and whether it is at all
        reasonable to achieve in the time given, using simple javascript remains to be seen.
        It might be better done by creating a gif with the desired effect in photoshop,
        otherwise it might require some image manipulation that would make loadtimes insufferable,
        whether through using some sort of filter, or by some kind of neural network, neither of
        which would be reasonable to execute clientside.
      </p>
      <h3>kontakt.js</h3>
      <p>
        kontakt.js is one of the tasks on the edge of the scope of this course, being reasonably
        routine to achieve using frameworks or backends it might prove a significant challenge to
        achieve in a satisfactory way, such that contacting the architect does come off as
        annoying. While having a form open an empty outlook(or whatever else is the default mail
        client for the user) is relatively simple, it might very well be scrapped altogether as it
        is hardly an aesthetic solution. Some research will be made into seeing if prefilled
        emails are an option, or if there are any other clever workarounds.
      </p>
      <h3>Admin dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        Another idea that was briefly brought up, that could be of interest is to create a
        separate javascript app for uploading images to the project filesystem. This however is
        not something really covered by curriculum. A possible way of making one could be to
        add an extra tab to the navbar using logic "if url like 127:0:0:1" or something like that,
        to allow for graphical upload of projects that could later be uploaded to server.
        However this would be a somewhat clunky solution to a problem already outside the scope
        of the course, for which just making a backend by normal means would fare better.
      </p>
      <h3>koordinat.js</h3>
      <p>
        A continuation of kart.js that can take addresses either in global coordinates, or
        preferably street addresses, and then translate them into map coordinates for kart.js.
        This would make for a much more easily updated kart.js, however this is unlikely to be a
        trivial task.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Page Structure and List of Files and Folders</h2>
      <p>
        Below is an overview of the planned page structure. Note that not every image is
        included, both for ease of reading, and because it might be subject to change.
        Central to the way the project will function is the usage of a separate file,
        data.js, to keep track of information. This is a step toward not only developer
        happiness, but also modularity, by having
        most data available in one spot, for easy updates, changes, and reusability.
        It will be used to store the paths of project images, as well as descriptive data, like
        dates, location, category, and descriptions.
        This also makes for a much more realistic transition to a programming free update process
        if that should ever be of desire in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        A script will generate a gallery using the above mentioned datafile, it will take a
        filter as input, and render a grid of thumbnail images matching the criteria.
        The usage of filter as input allows for using the exact same function to display
        a variety of different galleries.

        To choose between different ways of viewing the projects a hamburger menu will be
        implemented. This hamburger menu will largely be reused as a substitute for navbar
        on smaller viewports.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project will have distinct folders for different types of files, one for html,
        one for css, one for images, one for scripts, as well as one for data. To clarify
        what's meant by "data" in this context: it will function basically as a "how to connect"
        guide for the page. While the data.js file technically is a script file this helps further
        emphasize that it will not itself be responsible for any functionality.
        There will also be accompanying readmes for explaining whereever necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a possibility that not all of those css files will be necessary, so that's subject
        to change. Also subject to change, and if performance becomes a bottleneck they might
        be merged so as to reduce the number of http requests. However as for now this level of
        modularity keeps the styling more transparent, and easy to keep track of.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also worth considering breaking the img/ folder down further, as it might get
        crowded with all of the different project images. A benefit to keeping it like this,
        however, is in the relative ease in creating paths and the straight forward structure.
        Given that data.js keeps track of files this would not infringe on the possibility of
        doing something like: "display all project images in this folder" either, as it would
        not be done by folder anyway, so the possibility of displaying a marker as a project is
        nil, even with catchall display functionality.

      <h2>Plan</h2>
      <p>
        ​All images and texts are already received from Bark, and the folder structure is already
        made.
        What is missing, is to write code, conduct user tests, implement changes and do error
        checking.
        Our plan is to have all code finished by 20th of october.
        The next week, until 27th of october, we will spend testing and implementing changes.
        Then we have one week for error checking.
