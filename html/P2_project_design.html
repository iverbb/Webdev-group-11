      <h2>Client</h2>
      <!-- Project: Outdo squarespace -->
      <p>Client:
        <a href="https://www.barkarkitekter.no/" target="_blank">
          Bark Arkitekter AS
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact Person: Frode Brurberg, CEO, partner and architect MNAL in Bark Arkitekter AS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bark Arkitekter (est. 2006) is a small architect firm based in Stavanger, Norway,
        that works on producing timeless building design in the Stavanger region.
        The firm consists of five architects MNAL who have all gotten their education from
        different parts of the world – Brighton, Auckland, Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen – making
        their design many-sided and unique.
        They aim to find the best solution for a building’s design in cooperation with
        the client, and are consistently trying to understand what it really is that the client
        wants.
        Bark’s projects vary from private houses and cabins to public schools and kindergartens,
        as well as commercial building projects.

      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is mainly to showcase Bark’s projects, attracting both
        customers and potential new employees. The website should work as an inspiring portfolio
        displaying their architectural projects in an appealing way. It has to show the whole
        spectrum of their work and the variation within each building category, making it clear
        that the building design is customized to both the client and the building’s surroundings.
        This can be done through making an own tab for projects, and then sorting them into
        different categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as being a pleasantly looking home for Bark’s projects, it has to be inviting for
        their clientele, making it feel easy to get in contact with the firm. Bark Arkitekter
        should not be presented as unattainable or as a mammoth in architecture design, but as
        the small, local and inviting firm it is. Bark also wants the clients to be able to be
        more active when visiting the website, making the experience more playful. This can be
        done by having interactive elements such as a map. The audience can navigate through the
        different projects visually and active by clicking on the different pinpoints on the map.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted, the website should attract potential new employees. This
        should be done through presenting Bark Arkitekter as an interesting,
        stimulating and professional workplace, and through being informative of
        the opportunities you’ve got when working for Bark.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion the website has to satisfy the needs of both an untrained
        private person as well as a professional architect, informing them of
        the opportunities they’ve got as clients or employees. It has to feel
        inviting for the visitors, making it seem easy to contact Bark and
        having a chat about a potential project. The website has to communicate
        Bark’s distinctive style, and to avoid presenting their projects as
        modular buildings.

      <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
      <p>
        ​A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using the terminology 
        learned in class and the notes on slides “HTML Cont.” in Storyboard and Structures sections (slides:122-129).

      <h2>Page Structure and List of Files and Folders</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a tentative overview of the planned files that should be part of the page.
        Note that as the number of projects is not currently known, and might be subject to
        it has just been shown as a general "projectN.png"(or json), where N shows project
        number, in case of multiple images in one project it will be displaed as N-M,
        to have a more predictable structure.

        Note that this notation is used in general, staffn is really short hand for
        staff1 .. staffn too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The page will have a navbar from which any of the basic webpages can be reached:
        A home page, to which the client should be able to reach from anywhich page whatsoever
        at the click of the logo, or by clicking "home" on the navbar.
        An "about us" page(possibly multiple? describing aspects of the company?).
        Inside the project tab there will be featured a selection of different ways in which to
        enjoy the visuals of the projects. Whether the client prefers browsing by recency
        (chronological), by location (a map), or project ideas that have not become a reality
        yet, he/she is sure to be pleased. We have not decided yet how many filter options there
        will be, but the three options mentioned are the the ones we have looked at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects will also have a detail view, where the client can read a little extra about
        the projects, as well as view the project images in fullsized glory. This page will be
        realized as a templated html which will be filled via a javascript function based on
        querystring. The option to view by location will feature a map over the greater Stavanger
        region, displaying markers for projects completed, which will show a small image from
        the project on hover, and a link to a detail view. If by recency or by category is
        chosen instead, then a gallery featuring the appropriate images will show instead.

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Loading page</h3>
      <p>
        When arriving at the website, the user will meet a jumping dot. Bark’s logo has a dot on the end 
        which we intend to utilize to make the loading of the page more interesting. We will use a JavaScript 
        function to make it jump for three seconds while the website is loading in the background. 
        We have given it the set time of three seconds as JavaScript can not detect when the website is finished loading.
        When the three seconds have passed, the dot will jump to its place in the logo in the navbar and the user 
        is free to explore Bark’s projects. In addition to the jumping dot letting the website and its pictures load 
        in the background, it is contributing to the website with a fun element.
