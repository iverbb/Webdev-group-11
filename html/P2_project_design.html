      <h2>Client</h2>
      <!-- Project: Outdo squarespace -->
      <p>Client:
        <a href="https://www.barkarkitekter.no/" target="_blank">
          Bark Arkitekter AS
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Contact Person: Frode Brurberg, CEO, partner and architect MNAL in Bark Arkitekter AS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bark Arkitekter (est. 2006) is a small architect firm based in Stavanger, Norway,
        that works on producing timeless building design in the Stavanger region.
        The firm consists of five architects MNAL who have all gotten their education from
        different parts of the world – Brighton, Auckland, Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen – making
        their design many-sided and unique.
        They aim to find the best solution for a building’s design in cooperation with
        the client, and are consistently trying to understand what it really is that the client
        wants.
        Bark’s projects vary from private houses and cabins to public schools and kindergartens,
        as well as commercial building projects.

      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is mainly to showcase Bark’s projects, attracting both
        customers and potential new employees. The website should work as an inspiring portfolio
        displaying their architectural projects in an appealing way. It has to show the whole
        spectrum of their work and the variation within each building category, making it clear
        that the building design is customized to both the client and the building’s surroundings.
        This can be done through making an own tab for projects, and then sorting them into
        different categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as being a pleasantly looking home for Bark’s projects, it has to be inviting for
        their clientele, making it feel easy to get in contact with the firm. Bark Arkitekter
        should not be presented as unattainable or as a mammoth in architecture design, but as
        the small, local and inviting firm it is. Bark also wants the clients to be able to be
        more active when visiting the website, making the experience more playful. This can be
        done by having interactive elements such as a map. The audience can navigate through the
        different projects visually and active by clicking on the different pinpoints on the map.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted, the website should attract potential new employees. This
        should be done through presenting Bark Arkitekter as an interesting,
        stimulating and professional workplace, and through being informative of
        the opportunities you’ve got when working for Bark.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion the website has to satisfy the needs of both an untrained
        private person as well as a professional architect, informing them of
        the opportunities they’ve got as clients or employees. It has to feel
        inviting for the visitors, making it seem easy to contact Bark and
        having a chat about a potential project. The website has to communicate
        Bark’s distinctive style, and to avoid presenting their projects as
        modular buildings.

      <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
      <p>
        ​A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using the terminology 
        learned in class and the notes on slides “HTML Cont.” in Storyboard and Structures sections (slides:122-129). 
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Page Structure and List of Files and Folders</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a tentative overview of the planned files that should be part of the page.
        Note that as the number of projects is not currently known, and might be subject to
        it has just been shown as a general "projectN.png"(or json), where N shows project
        number, in case of multiple images in one project it will be displaed as N-M,
        to have a more predictable structure.

        Note that this notation is used in general, staffn is really short hand for
        staff1 .. staffn too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The page will have a navbar from which any of the basic webpages can be reached:
        A home page, to which the client should be able to reach from anywhich page whatsoever
        at the click of the logo, or by clicking "home" on the navbar.
        An "about us" page(possibly multiple? describing aspects of the company?).
        Inside the project tab there will be featured a selection of different ways in which to
        enjoy the visuals of the projects. Whether the client prefers browsing by recency
        (chronological), by location (a map), or project ideas that have not become a reality
        yet, he/she is sure to be pleased. We have not decided yet how many filter options there
        will be, but the three options mentioned are the the ones we have looked at.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects will also have a detail view, where the client can read a little extra about
        the projects, as well as view the project images in fullsized glory. This page will be
        realized as a templated html which will be filled via a javascript function based on
        querystring. The option to view by location will feature a map over the greater Stavanger
        region, displaying markers for projects completed, which will show a small image from
        the project on hover, and a link to a detail view. If by recency or by category is
        chosen instead, then a gallery featuring the appropriate images will show instead.

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Loading page</h3>
      <p>
        When arriving at the website, the user will meet a jumping dot. Bark’s logo has a dot on the end 
        which we intend to utilize to make the loading of the page more interesting. We will use a JavaScript 
        function to make it jump for three seconds while the website is loading in the background. 
        We have given it the set time of three seconds as JavaScript can not detect when the website is finished loading.
        When the three seconds have passed, the dot will jump to its place in the logo in the navbar and the user 
        is free to explore Bark’s projects. In addition to the jumping dot letting the website and its pictures load 
        in the background, it is contributing to the website with a fun element.

      <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the groups relatively high work capacity we don't see the minimum requirements
        on javascript as particularly relevant, expecting to go well beyond them, in fact two
        javascript files were used in the creation of this page alone.
        We consider these functions to make up a minimum viable product, these also cover the
        minimum requirement posed by the assignment:
      </p>
      <h3>marg.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde will implement a script that automatically adds headers and footers to every
        html page. This aids in modularity by not having to write the same html over and over.
        A maybe even bigger advantage is that it makes for a more robust solution with respect
        to updates, as it eliminates the risk of forgetting to update the navbar of an html page.
        Due to current design not featuring a dropdown menu we consider this to be the most
        straight forward of all the scripts we have planned, and it should not present issues.
      </p>
      <h3>gallerimeny.js</h3>
      <p>
        Nora will implement gallerimeny.js, a burger menu that calls loads the appropriate
        project viewer, either a gallery or an interactive map, implemented separately.
        Functionality wise this would not be significantly harder than implementing a navbar;
        a list of hrefs, however it might be worth having it recognize whether it is in a
        gallery or a mapview, and if switching between gallery filters have it not reload the
        entire page, but rather call the appropriate filtering function of the gallery instead.
      </p>

      <h3>data.js</h3>
      <p>
        Hedvig will implement data.js, this is not functionally a script, but rather declares
        an object in which to store project data, with paths, descriptions and other relevant
        information, for ease of access. This is essentially a proxy json, as reading straight
        json files would be challenging without frameworks, and implementing an efficient
        json parser from scratch in javascript would be a very complex task.
      </p>
      <h3>galleri.js</h3>
      <p>
        Hedvig will implement galleri.js, a script that will display project images in a regular
        grid. It will load image data from data.js, filter according to input filter and
        load images from img/. Likely thumbnails will be made, so as not to make loading take
        too much time/bandwidth.
      </p>
      <h3>bildeviser.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver will implement bildeviser.js, a function that will show a larger sized image of
        a clicked thumbnail, with blurred/transparent background, and appropriately scaled
        imaged for a given viewport. It will show basic information about the project, such
        as production date, title, location, etc. There are also plans for the possibility
        for this to link to a more detailed information page on the project, if such information
        exists for a given project, however this is not part of the minimum requirements.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Planned</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        These are all the functionality that are planned as a main part of the project. We are
        fairly confident in achieving these goals. They are the ones marked with at most a single
        asterisk in the work distribution table. 
      </p>
      <h3>tidslinje.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde will implement tidslinje.js, a script for showing an interactive timeline over
        projects created by the company. It will feature a sidescrolling gallery of project
        thumbnails greyed out that will regain color on hover.
      </p>
      <h3>laster.js</h3>
      <p>
        Parisa will implement laster.js, a script that will display a dynamic loading animation
        prior to page load. We see three possible implementations of this: a gif running at
        predefined length, using displaying a gif for a duration dependent on
        "document.readyState", or implementing the animation using canvas, possibly with
        interactive easter eggs, however the latter falls squarely into the "nice to have"
        category, both due to technical challenges, and the relatively minor added value.
      </p>
      <h3>kart.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver will implement kart.js, an interactive map displaying projects on a map over
        Stavanger. Loading location from data.js it will display a marker on the map, which
        will on hover expand to a project view. This is more or less done already.
      </p>
      <h3>enkeltprosjekt.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver will create a function for filling html templates with project data and imagery
        based on querystring, likely using regex. This will make for easier sharing,
        either on social media, or peer to peer, as well as more modular updates, due to the
        lack of a need for making separate html pages for every new project added to the page.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Nice to Haves</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        These are files and ideas that would be cool to implement, but either are less relevant
        to the course, too technical to guarantee, or both. They will be given an honest effort,
        however we'll lose no sleep over not accomplishing them. As such they feature neither
        deadline nor specific asignee in the work distribution table. They are noted by double
        asterisk.
      </p>
      <h3>tegne.js</h3>
      <p>
        tegne.js is a task of obviously different scope from the others, and whether it is at all
        reasonable to achieve in the time given, using simple javascript remains to be seen.
        It might be better done by creating a gif with the desired effect in photoshop,
        otherwise it might require some image manipulation that would make loadtimes insufferable,
        whther through using some sort of filter, or by some kind of neural network, neither of
        which would be reasonable to execute clientside.
      </p>
      <h3>tegne.js</h3>
      <p>
        kontakt.js is one of the tasks on the edge of the scope of this course, being reasonably
        routine to achieve using frameworks or backends it might prove a significant challenge to
        achieve in a satisfactory way, such that contacting the architect does come off as
        annoying. While having a form open an empty outlook(or whatever else is the default mail
        client for the user) is relatively simple, it might very well be scrapped altogether as it
        is hardly an aesthetic solution. Some research will be made into seeing if prefilled
        emails are an option, or if there are any other clever workarounds.
      </p>
      <h3>Admin dashboard</h3>
      <p>
        Another idea that was briefly brought up, that could be of interest is to create a
        separate javascript app for uploading images to the project filesystem. This however is
        not something really covered by curriculum. A possible way of making one could be to
        add an extra tab to the navbar using logic "if url like 127:0:0:1" or something like that,
        to allow for graphical upload of projects that could later be uploaded to server.
        However this would be a somewhat clunky solution to a problem already outside the scope
        of the course, for which just making a backend by normal means would fare better.
      </p>
      <h3>koordinat.js</h3>
      <p>
        A continuation of kart.js that can take addresses either in global coordinates, or
        preferably street addresses, and then translate them into map coordinates for kart.js.
        This would make for a much more easily updated kart.js, however might pose a significant
        challenge.
