    <h2>Design changes</h2>
      <p>
        We put down a lot of time developing the design for Bark’s website, and used Figma to properly display choices regarding both graphic design solutions and navigation structure. 
        By having a greatly detailed prototype in Figma, we were at all times able to see how we fulfilled our design plans with our code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As we were rather ambitious with our prototype and project requirements, the workload became quite large and we were challenged both in terms of time and work capacity. 
        This led us letting go of some of our functions described in the prototype and P2. 
        However, enjoying working with the website, we also added functionalities not included in our prototype to elevate the user experience. 
      </p>
    <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        In the landing page we made some design and functionality changes. 
        We removed the functionality of a manual or automatic slideshow on the front image. 
        This was due to it giving the website an old-fashioned feeling, which was not intended. 
        By simply having one static image of Bark’s office building, the first impression became cleaner and more modern.
      </p>
      <p>
        However we still wanted to include a slideshow to make the website more interactive, as Bark wished for. 
        We therefore included the slideshow to the home page as an additional and secondary element, having it not be the main focus. 
        By changing the news’ three boxes into a slideshow, we were enabling the visitor to scroll through all of Bark’s news posts, not only the three last published. 
        As well as adding arrows to navigate between the news posts, we included grey dots underneath the posts. 
        The dots are functioning both as a visual signifier of the amount of news posts available, in addition to enabling a supplementary method of navigation. 
        Moreover the grey dots are giving the slideshow a more thorough feel. 
        The voluntary news slideshow is a nice treat to the visitor in comparison to the mandatory large slideshow. 
      </p>
    <h3>Project page</h3>
      <p>
        To make the image grid of the projects have the most wholesome look, we decided upon using a black and white filter on all images except from "Prosjekttype" page, and having them colored on hover. 
        We discovered that this was the simplest way to make all filtered image galleries have the same style and harmonize. 
        When hovering the name of the project and the finish year is placed next to each other instead of on each side of the image. 
        This choice was made for simplicity. 
        We wanted to introduce the user to coloured images on “Prosjekttype” and fixed caption underneath the images to make it stand out as the introductory page the user is introduced to when clicking on the “Prosjekter” button in the navbar . 
      </p>
      <p>
        The hamburger menu from the prototype was replaced with a “Sorter”-button. 
        This was a consequence of our solution for the responsive design also including a hamburger menu in the navigation bar. 
        For small viewports the website would therefore have two hamburger menus with different functionalities, which is neither clever nor user friendly design. 
        To avoid confusion we therefore chose to have the button signify its exact functionality. 
        In addition we added a “tilbake”-button, both for functionality and graphic symmetry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The images in the image grid were made to take up less of the vertical room. 
        This decision was made from both a graphic and functional point of view. Making the images shorter enabled having more images in the viewport, which in hand resulted in easier and more pleasant navigation. 
        We were made aware that it is not too satisfying when images are sized too large and covering the whole screen.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We replaced “Annet” with “Ideer” as the last project type. 
        Consequently we also removed “Ideer” from the dropdown sorting menu. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When sorting on “Beliggenhet” we used a self drawn map instead of the one provided by Bark to make it more accurate, in addition to some more distinct markers. 
        We also decided upon not having markers for Bark’s projects for private housing, due to it being somewhat strange giving the exact location for earlier customers’ homes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When clicking at a project an overlay with a larger image and additional information is displayed. 
        The title in the overlay is placed on the left side so it is aligned with the short description. 
      </p>
    <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        In the “Om oss” page we have edited the timeline quite a bit. 
        Firstly, it has been made without a javascript as we found it unnecessary. 
        We could have used javascript for the timeline to be more interactive, possibly giving it a sliding function, but we decided that this was not a vital function and therefore not to be prioritized. 
        We could probably have implemented it quite easily, but we didn’t spend time on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the choice of avoiding to write additional javascript code resulted in the timeline being hidden on smaller viewports due to it looking rather bad, and the readability got worse, when made small. 
        The timeline is therefore working as an extra treat for those who visit the website on their desktop or tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The images in the timeline are put in grayscale to correspond to the rest of the website, and are therefore also colored on hover. 
        To give the timeline a more playful character we have added a small transformation so the images “jump” on hover. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore the timeline does not pass the set margin for the page. 
        This is a better solution when taking responsive design into consideration. 
        Instead of adding “se mer” and arrows to the overlay of the timeline, we have used the same overlay as in the project page for modularity. 
      </p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        In the contact page we decided on not having the illustration on how the building process works. 
        This decision was made because we wanted the illustration to be made by Bark for it to be in the same style as the rest of the website. 
        Bark could not find the time to make the illustration. 
      </p>
    <h3>Other changes</h3>
      <p>
        We scratched making the koordinat.js due to it not being too important, giving us more time to work on the other parts of the website. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For larger viewports the margin increases. 
        This is a choice based on website standards. 
        If the margin had simply stayed 5% for all viewports, viewers on larger viewports would become overwhelmed by the content. 
        The massivity would make the website feel messy and unpleasant. By using larger margins instead, we made the website more comprehensible, logical and accessible, in the end making it more user-friendly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The illustration “video”/gif for “På tegnebordet” was also abandoned. 
        This element was not crucial, and we therefore decided upon leaving it. 
        Making it would have been both laborious and time consuming.  
        As the illustrations were already made, we would have had to edit out one and one line in photoshop, which did not seem like constructive usage of time.

    <h2>Minimum requirements</h2>
    <h3>Marg.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde implemented a script that automatically adds headers and footers to every html page. 
        This aids in modularity by not having to write the same html over and over. 
      </p>
    <h3>Sortprojects.js</h3>
      <p>
        Nora implemented a menu that loads the appropriate project viewer, either a gallery or an interactive map, implemented separately. 
        This gives the viewer the possibility of sorting Bark’s projects based on when, where and type.  
      </p>
    <h3>Prosjektlist.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde and Hedvig implemented prosjektlist.js. 
        This is not functionally a script, but declares an object in which to store project data, with paths, descriptions and other relevant information, for ease of access.  
      </p>
    <h3>Galleri.js</h3>
      <p>
        Hedvig implemented galleri.js, a script that displays project images in a regular grid. 
        It loads image data from prosjektlist.js, filters according to input filter and load images from img/.  
        The data is loaded mainly from prosjektlist.js for modularity and where it was convenient to do so. 
      </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Additonal functions</h2>
    <h3>Bildeviser.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver implemented bildeviser.js, a function that shows a larger sized image of a clicked thumbnail, with transparent background, and appropriately scaled images for a given viewport. 
        It shows basic information about the project, such as project name, a description, start and finish year, type, location and status.
      </p>
    <h3>Loadingpage.js</h3>
      <p>
        Parisa implemented loading_page.html, an html with an inline script that displays a dynamic loading animation prior to page load.
        This is an implementation displaying a gif playing for 1.9 seconds.
      </p>
    <h3>Kart.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver implemented kart.js, an interactive map displaying projects on a map over Stavanger. 
        Loading location from prosjektlist.js it displays a marker on the map, which on hover expands to a project view.
      </p>
    <h3>Mobilmeny.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver implemented mobilmeny.js which is a burger menu that replaces the navbar for smaller viewports.
      </p>
    <h3>Velgmeny.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver implemented velgmeny.js which registers the viewports size and based on this chooses to load either the navigation bar or the hamburger menu.
      </p>
    <h3>Enkeltprosjekt.js</h3>
      <p>
        Iver implemented enkeltprosjekt.js.
      </p>
    <h3>Favicon.js</h3>
      <p>
        Vilde implemented a simple script for loading a favicon to all pages.
        Favicons could have been added in the head section of all htmls, but with the script it takes less effort if the favicon was to be changed.
      </p>
    <h3>Slideshow.js</h3>
      <p>
        Hedvig implemented slideshow.js for the newsroom in the home page.
        This allows the visitor to be more active when scrolling through the news.
        It also allows Bark to publish a larger amount of news as it loads data from prosjektlist.js.

        As we were working with an architecture firm that wanted a clean website to display their projects, we did not need to produce a large amount of extra design features or artwork.
        Instead of creating our own artwork we used Bark’s project sketches and images to add colour to the website.

    <h2>Handling and implementing modularity</h2>
    <p>
      We implemented external scripts to handle the criteria of modularity. 
      Iver and Hedvig had the greatest responsibility in this regard, but Nora and Vilde also contributed.
      By calling javascript codes in each html file we managed to make our files shorter, as well as relieving ourselves of writing the same code several times. 
      This was also helpful for us only having to change one file if something regarding all the pages that included a given function was to be changed – both in regards to functionality and aesthetics.  
    </p>
    <p>
      All project pages have individual html files, however the gallery CSS as well as sorting and filter options for all of them are generated by the same stylesheet and the same javascript file. 
      We also used the javascript file, prosjektlist.js, to access all the necessary info about each image in one place. 
      Vilde and Hedvig were responsible for this file.
      These initiatives towards modularity minimized both the length of coding as we have only made one filter function, one sorting function, one grid function and one object list that apply to all the project pages. 
      This prevented us from writing code more than one time, and making it easy to handle, edit and use in several HTML pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first we wrote separate css files for each page. 
      To minimize the number of different files we have added all possible styling to the main css. 
      Vilde, Hedvig and Nora were responsible for this.
      We have also tried to avoid inline styling as far as possible.

    <h2>Challenges when developing the website</h2>
    <p>
      As our ambitions for the website were rather high, it is needless to say that we met some challenges along the way.   
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were making a website displaying an architecture firm’s projects, we needed to upload a great load of images to our git. 
      In the aftermath of the uploading we were made aware of git’s limited capacity. 
      The images took up a lot of space and we therefore explored the opportunity of storing the images in our drive, and having a function fetch them from the external repository. 
      However, as we had already uploaded the images to our git, the images were saved in the git’s history and took up space even when deleted. 
      We therefore chose to continue with the internal image repository, but limiting the amount of images for each project. 
      n the end, the goal is to show how the projects are filtered by using a selection of images, which is what we have implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the big amount of large images, the website is also loading quite slowly, which can be both frustrating and confusing for the user. 
      Additionally some of the functionalities that involve images are working on random. There is no system in when they are working and when they are not. 
      This is especially a problem for the overlay. 
      Sometimes the image loads correctly, sometimes the wrong image is loaded, and sometimes nothing is loaded. 
      We are suspecting that the linking in the scripts might be the root of the problem. We are however yet to find a proper explanation for this issue. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover there were some challenges regarding the use of a javascript function to handle the images. 
      The naming of the image paths were prone to error as they were not automatically filled in. 
      Unforeseen changes constantly leading to manual rewriting of code was also quite tiresome. 
      In hindsight it’s clear to see that we should have restricted ourselves with the amount of images to ease our workload. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The footer also posed some challenges – it would not stay at the bottom of the page for “på tegnebordet”, “om oss” and “kontakt”. 
      Somehow the structure of these pages allowed the footer to travel up to the middle of the page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In “Kontakt” we wanted to add a link to the office position in google maps through the image. 
      When giving the image a link, the layout of the page was broken. 
      This would be something we could spend time on troubleshooting if we had the time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the map in “beliggenhet” we had some trouble with it working with the sorting button. 
      Somehow they would not work together. 
      In addition there were some challenges getting the markers to stay in the right position
      in the map when the viewport got smaller. Further difficulties were encountered trying to
      calculate the correct locations on the map, given that map APIs like google's were not
      allowed to be used. As a result it was particularly tricky to determine the edges of the
      map, leading to a need for resorting to using free geolocating tools to approximate by eye.
      This got particularly egregious when estimating the right edge of the map, given it fell in
      the middle of the ocean, as such it was calculated by means of function. Furthermore it
      turned somewhat tricky to make sure this was calculated properly, before markers were to
      be drawn, in a sense it behaved sort of like a race condition, where if this calculation
      started before the image was loaded it would not calculate even remotely reasonable
      x-coordinates for the markers, as they depended on the image width to calculate offset.
      Further issues also included making markers appear correctly, as hardcoded pixel offsets
      made for slightly moving coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some general troubles with the javascript functions. 
      We found it somewhat difficult to understand the possibilities with using javascript. 
      With HTML and CSS it was a lot easier to understand the different actions, as we could constantly get visual feedback on what we were doing. 
      The aspect of modularity also offered some challenges. 
      It was difficult and frustrating understanding how we got our modular functions to do what we wanted them to – especially when elements that were quite simple to make with HTML and CSS presented themselves as a lot more difficult to implement with Javascript. 
      However, when finally getting the functions to work we understood why the modular scripts are preferable. 
      We put a lot of time and struggle into making the code modular, simple and clean. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even distribution of workload was also rather complicated. It was not as simple as assigning the same amount of tasks to everyone in the group. 
      To predict how much work the different tasks would demand was quite difficult, both because of the different team mates’ programming skills and how difficult the different tasks actually were. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An aspect which offered both challenges and advantages was the fact that our group resides in three different parts of the world. 
      Cooperation over different countries and time zones was challenging especially due to technical issues. 
      Our meetings depended on good internet connection technical equipment working. 
      It has nevertheless been greatly eye-opening working interdisciplinary.
