    <h2>Client</h2>
    <!-- Project: Outdo squarespace -->
    <p>Client:
        <a href="https://www.barkarkitekter.no/" target="_blank">
            Bark Arkitekter AS
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Contact Person: Frode Brurberg, CEO, partner and architect MNAL in Bark Arkitekter AS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bark Arkitekter (est. 2006) is a small architect firm based in Stavanger, Norway, that works on producing timeless building design in the Stavanger region.
      The firm consists of five architects MNAL who have all gotten their education from different parts of the world – Brighton, Auckland, Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen – making their design many-sided and unique.
      They aim to find the best solution for a building’s design in cooperation with the client, and are consistently trying to understand what it really is that the client wants.
      Bark’s projects vary from private houses and cabins to public schools and kindergartens, as well as commercial building projects.

    <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of the website is mainly to showcase Bark’s projects, attracting both customers and potential new employees.
      The website should work as an inspiring portfolio displaying their architectural projects in an appealing way.
      It has to show the whole spectrum of their work and the variation within each building category, making it clear that the building design is customized to both the client and the building’s surroundings.
      This can be done through making an own tab for projects, and then sorting them into different categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      As well as being a pleasantly looking home for Bark’s projects, it has to be inviting for their clientele, making it feel easy to get in contact with the firm.
      Bark Arkitekter should not be presented as unattainable or as a mammoth in architecture design, but as the small, local and inviting firm it is.
      Bark also wants the clients to be able to be more active when visiting the website, making the experience more playful.
      This can be done by having interactive elements such as a map.
      The audience can navigate through the different projects visually and active by clicking on the different pinpoints on the map.
    </p>
    <p>
      As noted, the website should attract potential new employees.
      This should be done through presenting Bark Arkitekter as an interesting, stimulating and professional workplace, and through being informative of the opportunities you’ve got when working for Bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion the website has to satisfy the needs of both an untrained private person as well as a professional architect, informing them of the opportunities they’ve got as clients or employees.
      It has to feel inviting for the visitors, making it seem easy to contact Bark and having a chat about a potential project.
      The website has to communicate Bark’s distinctive style, and to avoid presenting their projects as modular buildings.
    </p>

    <h2>Target Demography</h2>
    <p>
      The visitors of the website are private clients, professional building developers, commercial actors, public developers, potential new employees and partners, students and people interested in architecture.
      The website will be in Norwegian due to the fact that Bark's clientele is Norwegian.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the private clients the website should give information of how the whole process works – from drawing to building.
      It should show what their possibilities and opportunities as customers are, as well as making them able to explore and look at earlier projects done by Bark.
      It is important that the website is inviting for the private customers, as they need to feel like it is easy to get in contact with the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the professional building developers the website has to make it clear that Bark also works with larger projects, and not only smaller private housing.
      This also applies to the municipal or state actors.
      Bark Arkitekter has been working with public projects such as schools and kindergartens, so these projects need to be drawn attention to.
    </p>
    <p>
      As mentioned, for attracting potential new employees, the website needs to make Bark Arkitekter look like an interesting and diverse workplace.
      The website needs to include their portfolio, inspirational work, photography and drawings of earlier and current projects, as well as news of on-going projects or publicity in papers or magazines.
      It has to be continuously updated with what Bark is doing in their current projects for it to be visible that they are active and relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      These demands apply for students or other people who are interested in architecture as well.
      As these visitors are interested in aesthetics, it is crucial that the website is visually pleasing and interesting with possibilities to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to take the entire audience into account when shaping the website, however some of the visitors are more important to satisfy than others.
      As this is a private firm dependent on paying projects, the private clients are especially vital.
      The aesthetics of the website has to accentuate the remarkable parts of their architectural work, making it attractive to hire Bark Arkitekter.
      Potential new employees are also prioritized when making the website.
      Additionally, private and municipal developers should be considered, even though they often have premade deals with firms or launch competitions in order to find a fitting architect.

    <h2>Website Architecture</h2>
    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>
      The home page will be an introduction page for the website, making it essential that it gives the visitor a great first impression of Bark Arkitekter.
      It has to be visually pleasing, sparking an interest, and easy to navigate in.
      Bark specified that the websites need to have a menu available at all times, making it easy to navigate for all visitors.
      They also specified that the website needs to include a page where their current projects are displayed.
      We are therefore exploring the possibility of making them able to share their current projects “på tegnebordet” (“on the drawing board”), and to share news of citations in magazines etc. here.
    </p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
    <p>
      We will need to make a page with contact information, describing where you can find Bark Arkitekter and how you can reach them: the office address, phone number and email address.
      It should inform clients how they can get in contact.
      As the firm is dependent on clients, this page needs to feel like it is inviting to a conversation and in addition it has to make it clear that it’s simple to get in contact with them.
    </p>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      There has to be a page where the firm can brand themselves – who are they and what is their vision.
      This page should include information about the firm, the employees, and how they do their work.
      We are possibly including a description of the whole building process, from the client making contact to sketching ideas to the final result.
    </p>
    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
      As we need to include Bark’s portfolio, we need to make a page for all of their projects.
      This page has to make some kind of sorting of content possible.
      Most essential is sorting through the different types of building projects: holiday homes, residential housing, smaller buildings, commercial buildings and other projects.
      We are also exploring the possibility of making several filtering functions – chronologically, alphabetical, programmatic, scale and status.
      We would also like to try to include a map showing where the buildings are located.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Detail View</h3>
    <p>
      A page template for displaying images in details, should be able to automatically
      generate a page from given input image(s) and text. Likely to use URLs with query
      string to make room for extension to accomodate future images. This will require a
      javascript function that can draw a reasonable pageview for a single page given
      the ID of a project as a URL.
    </p>
    <h3>Project map</h3>
    <p>
      Create an interactive map in which projects can be displayed on a map of the
      Stavanger area. Requires a javascript function that can take a coordinate, one
      or more images, and draw a marker on a map. This marker should contain an URL
      to a project page.
    </p>
    <h3>Project Data</h3>
    <p>
      Although not a visible part of the website the storage of project data will be done via
      a JSON object, in which each project will be anotated with an ID, a name, one or more
      images, an optional text description, as well as optional coordinates(projects without
      coordinates will not be displayed on the map).
    </p>
    <h3>Header</h3>
    <p>
      The header needs to include all of these pages, as well as the logo, at all times.
      This is to make navigation as simple as possible.
      If possible there could be some movement on the site which could contribute to a more playful experience, but having in mind that it will not cause disturbances nor annoyance.

    <h2>Client Preferences</h2>
    <p>
      Bark Arkitekter, being an architecture firm, wants the website to have a pleasing design.
      They want a clean and simple layout, but with active elements that make the website feel more playful.
      The color palette should not be dominating, but color should instead be integrated through the drawings and photographs of their projects.
      Fonts used in headlines and descriptions should be simple and easy to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the stylistic demands from Bark, they would also like us to make it clear that their firm has a green and sustainable approach to architecture.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Location</h2>
    <p>
      The final location of the website is currently not decided.
      Bark Arkitekter will probably not use our suggestion as their new website because of difficulties regarding the constant updating of their projects.
      We can’t expect them to learn programming in order to be able to update their content.
      It is more likely that they will continue to use their current website, which is a simple squarespace website.
      However, they might implement some of our design and structured solutions.
      Hence we believe that the final location might have to be at one of our student servers.

    <h2>Roadblocks and Technical Difficulties</h2>
    <p>
      One technical difficulty is that updates become cumbersome, as databases are not available, thus making an admin dashboard amounts to hacking, i.e. most likely impossible or impractical.
      A possibility is to make a script in some other language to be run on the backend, if we want to make updates as easy as possible for the client. However, it still constitutes a break in automation.
      It might be possible to port the website to some backend framework after course conclusion, but this might require some extra effort. A backend server is therefore not the priority throughout the course, but more of a possible alternative later on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prefilled emails opened in the user’s own email software could be a possibility, but it
      is still less practical than simply having an application stored directly on the website,
      or sent as email directly from form completion.
      Handling custom url queries might prove challenging, and it is not a given that
      making a template that can easily handle varying number of images in varying shapes
      and sizes is a straight forward task either.
      The thought of having a map could be challenging. Adjusting map view coordinates
      to real coordinates might be somewhat challenging, and even more so, considering the
      client might very well have these in street address form. Handling map replacements and
      size increases, in the event of new projects completed outside original area too might
      pose a challenge. One option is to use a large map and zoom it.
      It's also worth noting that obtaining an aesthetically pleasing and fitting map in and
      of itself might be a challenging task. Google map api or similar both require frameworks
      and work on a pay per click basis, and while the rate is generally low it likely won't
      be acceptable for the course in any way shape or form. It is also not given that a standard
      map would fit, either in color, or in terms of level of detail.
      <br/>
      This might cause loading issues, if the image is large. Might be worth looking into
      making a stylized map in svg. The same concern regarding loading time could happen
      with potential videos, gifs or other animation on the website.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another challenge might be to find a way to create a reasonable design for smaller
      viewports, seeing as images and design play such a central role in the function of
      the website. As such there might be a need for relatively large modifications to
      the website when viewed on phones.
