    <h2>Design changes</h2>
      <p>
        We put down a lot of time developing the design for Bark’s website, and used Figma to properly display choices regarding both graphic design solutions and navigation structure. 
        By having a greatly detailed prototype in Figma, we were at all times able to see how we fulfilled our design plans with our code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As we were rather ambitious with our prototype and project requirements, the workload became quite large and we were challenged both in terms of time and work capacity. 
        This led us letting go of some of our functions described in the prototype and P2. 
        However, enjoying working with the website, we also added functionalities not included in our prototype to elevate the user experience. 
      </p>
    <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        In the landing page we made some design and functionality changes. 
        We removed the functionality of a manual or automatic slideshow on the front image. 
        This was due to it giving the website an old-fashioned feeling, which was not intended. 
        By simply having one static image of Bark’s office building, the first impression became cleaner and more modern.
      </p>
      <p>
        However we still wanted to include a slideshow to make the website more interactive, as Bark wished for. 
        We therefore included the slideshow to the home page as an additional and secondary element, having it not be the main focus. 
        By changing the news’ three boxes into a slideshow, we were enabling the visitor to scroll through all of Bark’s news posts, not only the three last published. 
        As well as adding arrows to navigate between the news posts, we included grey dots underneath the posts. 
        The dots are functioning both as a visual signifier of the amount of news posts available, in addition to enabling a supplementary method of navigation. 
        Moreover the grey dots are giving the slideshow a more thorough feel. 
        The voluntary news slideshow is a nice treat to the visitor in comparison to the mandatory large slideshow. 
      </p>
    <h3>Project page</h3>
      <p>
        To make the image grid of the projects have the most wholesome look, we decided upon using a black and white filter on all images, and having them colored on hover. 
        We discovered that this was the simplest way to make all images have the same style and harmonize. 
        When hovering the name of the project and the finish year is placed next to each other instead of on each side of the image. 
        This choice was made for simplicity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The hamburger menu from the prototype was replaced with a “Sorter”-button. 
        This was a consequence of our solution for the responsive design also including a hamburger menu in the navigation bar. 
        For small viewports the website would therefore have two hamburger menus with different functionalities, which is neither clever nor user friendly design. 
        To avoid confusion we therefore chose to have the button signify its exact functionality. 
        In addition we added a “tilbake”-button, both for functionality and graphic symmetry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The images in the image grid were made to take up less of the vertical room. 
        This decision was made from both a graphic and functional point of view. Making the images shorter enabled having more images in the viewport, which in hand resulted in easier and more pleasant navigation. 
        We were made aware that it is not too satisfying when images are sized too large and covering the whole screen.  
      </p>
      <p>
        We replaced “Annet” with “Ideer” as the last project type. 
        Consequently we also removed “Ideer” from the dropdown sorting menu. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When sorting on “Beliggenhet” we used a self drawn map instead of the one provided by Bark to make it more accurate, in addition to some more distinct markers. 
        We also decided upon not having markers for Bark’s projects for private housing, due to it being somewhat strange giving the exact location for earlier customers’ homes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When clicking at a project an overlay with a larger image and additional information is displayed. 
        The title in the overlay is placed on the left side so it is aligned with the short description. 
      </p>
    <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        In the “Om oss” page we have edited the timeline quite a bit. 
        Firstly, it has been made without a javascript as we found it unnecessary. 
        We could have used javascript for it to be more interactive, possibly giving it a sliding function, but we decided that this was not a vital function and therefore not to be prioritized. 
        We could probably have implemented it quite easily, but we didn’t spend time on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the choice of avoiding to write additional javascript code resulted in the timeline being hidden on smaller viewports due to it looking rather bad, and the readability being rather bad, when made small. 
        The timeline is therefore working as an extra treat for those who visit the website on their desktop or tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The images in the timeline are put in grayscale to correspond to the rest of the website, and are therefore also colored on hover. 
        To give the timeline a more playful character we have added a small transformation so the images “jump” on hover. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore the timeline does not pass the set margin for the page. 
        This is a better solution when taking responsive design into consideration. 
        Instead of adding “se mer” and arrows to the overlay of the timeline, we have used the same overlay as in the project page for modularity. 
      </p>
    <h3>Contact</h3>
      <p>
        In the contact page we decided on not having the illustration on how the building process works. 
        This decision was made because we wanted the illustration to be made by Bark for it to be in the same style as the rest of the website. 
        Bark could not find the time to make the illustration. 
      </p>
